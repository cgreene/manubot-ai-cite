## Methods and materials {#sec:methods}

PhenoPLIER is a framework that combines various computational approaches to integrate gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses with groups of functionally-related genes (referred to as gene modules or latent variables/LVs).
PrediXcan family of methods are used to calculate gene-trait associations, while MultiPLIER models are applied on large gene expression compendia to infer latent variables.
PhenoPLIER provides three main components: 1) a regression model to compute an LV-trait association, 2) a consensus clustering approach applied to the latent space to identify shared and distinct transcriptomic properties between traits, and 3) an interpretable, LV-based drug repurposing framework.
The details of these methods are outlined below.


### The PrediXcan family of methods for gene-based associations {#sec:methods:predixcan}

Both methods compute the association between a trait and a gene by regressing the gene's predicted expression on the GWAS summary statistics, using the following equation:

We used Summary-PrediXcan (S-PrediXcan) [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] and Summary-MultiXcan (S-MultiXcan) [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889], both belonging to the PrediXcan family of methods [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], as the gene-based statistical approaches.
We refer to these approaches collectively as TWAS (transcription-wide association studies).
S-PrediXcan computes the univariate association between a trait and a gene's predicted expression in a single tissue, while S-MultiXcan computes the joint association between a gene's predicted expression in all tissues and a trait.
These methods only need GWAS summary statistics instead of individual-level genotype and phenotype data.
They calculate the association between a trait and a gene by regressing the gene's predicted expression on the GWAS summary statistics, using the following equation:

We briefly describe the TWAS methods necessary to explain our regression framework later (see the referenced articles for more information).
Let $\mathbf{y}$ be a vector of traits for $n$ individuals, centered for convenience (so that no intercept is necessary).
We denote $\mathbf{\tilde{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ as the gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$, where $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ its weight in the tissue prediction model $l$.
The standardized version of $\mathbf{\tilde{t}}_l$, denoted as $\mathbf{t}_l$, has mean equal to zero and standard deviation equal to one.

We used S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] to project genetic associations through gene expression patterns in order to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
S-PrediXcan is the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using the univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$.
The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).
The genotype variances and covariances were estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.

S-MultiXcan (referenced in @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889) is a summary version of MultiXcan, which is more powerful than PrediXcan in detecting gene-trait associations, though it does not provide the direction of effects.
Its main output is the $p$-value (obtained with an F-test) of the multiple tissue model, as expressed in Equation (@eq:multixcan).
To arrive at this expression, S-MultiXcan uses the conservative approximation $\sigma_{e}^{2} \approx \sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$, that is, the variance of the error terms in the joint regression is approximately equal to the residual variance of the marginal regressions.
Additionally, $Cor(\mathbf{T})$ is estimated using a global genotype covariance matrix, whereas marginal $\hat{z}_l$ in Equation (@eq:spredixcan) are approximated using tissue-specific genotype covariances.
This yields a test statistic of $\mathbf{\hat{z}}^{\top} Cor(\mathbf{T})^{-1} \mathbf{\hat{z}} \sim \chi_k^2$, where $\mathbf{\hat{z}}$ is a vector with $p$ $z$-scores and $Cor(\mathbf{T})$ is the autocorrelation matrix of $\mathbf{T}$.
As S-MultiXcan yields highly concordant estimates compared with MultiXcan, we used S-MultiXcan results for our LV-based regression model and our cluster analyses of traits.
However, results are not perfectly correlated across genes [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889], which is important to consider when computing the gene-gene correlation matrix.


### TWAS resources {#sec:methods:twas}

We used two large TWAS resources from European ancestries for discovery and replication.
The discovery cohort, PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083], provides results on 4,091 traits across various categories (Supplementary File 1 contains details about the included GWAS, sample size, and disease/trait categories).
With PrediXcan and fastENLOC [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.11.012], we computed gene-based associations and a posterior probability of colocalization between GWAS loci and *cis*-eQTL.
We refer to the matrix of $z$-scores from S-PrediXcan (Equation (@eq:spredixcan)) across $q$ traits and $m$ genes in tissue $t$ as $\mathbf{M}^{t} \in \mathbb{R}^{q \times m}$.
This matrix was used in our LV-based drug repurposing framework, as it provides direction of effects.
The S-MultiXcan results (22,515 gene associations across 4,091 traits) were used in our LV-based regression framework and our cluster analyses of traits.
For the latter, we converted $p$-values to $z$-scores via the probit function $\mathbf{M}=\Phi^{-1}(1 - p/2)$.
Higher $z$-scores indicate stronger associations.

We used the same set of gene expression data to calculate the gene co-expression network (GCN) using the WGCNA package [@doi:10.3389/fgene.2020.00245].
The GCN was used to identify clusters of genes associated with the same phecodes, and to identify therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

Our discovery cohort was eMERGE [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72], which we used to replicate associations found with our LV-based regression framework in PhenomeXcan.
We then calculated the gene co-expression network (GCN) using the WGCNA package [@doi:10.3389/fgene.2020.00245] with the same set of gene expression data.
This GCN was used to identify clusters of genes associated with 309 phecodes across different categories (more information


### MultiPLIER and Pathway-level information extractor (PLIER) {#sec:methods:multiplier}

MultiPLIER was used to extract gene co-expression patterns from recount2 without including GTEx samples.
The approach applied the pathway-level information extractor method (PLIER) [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1], which performs unsupervised learning utilizing prior knowledge (canonical pathways) to reduce technical noise.
PLIER utilizes a matrix factorization approach to deconvolute gene expression data into a set of latent variables (LV), each representing a gene module.
MultiPLIER was able to reduce the dimensionality of recount2 to 987 LVs.

Given a gene expression dataset $\mathbf{Y}^{m \times c}$ with $m$ genes and $c$ experimental conditions, and a prior knowledge matrix $\mathbf{C} \in \{0,1\}^{m \times p}$ for $p$ MSigDB pathways [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2015.12.004], PLIER finds $\mathbf{U}$, $\mathbf{Z}$, and $\mathbf{B}$ by minimizing the following equation: 
$$
||\mathbf{Y} - \mathbf{Z}\mathbf{B}||^{2}_{F} + \lambda_1 ||\mathbf{Z} - \mathbf{C}\mathbf{U}||^{2}_{F} + \lambda_2 ||\mathbf{B}||^{2}_{F} + \lambda_3 ||\mathbf{U}||_{L^1}
$$ {#eq:met:plier_func}, subject to $\mathbf{U}>0, \mathbf{Z}>0$.
Here, $\mathbf{Z}^{m \times l}$ are the gene loadings with $l$ latent variables, $\mathbf{B}^{l \times c}$ is the latent space for $c$ conditions, $\mathbf{U}^{p \times l}$ specifies which of the $p$ prior-information pathways in $\mathbf{C}$ are represented for each LV, and $\lambda_i$ are different regularization parameters used in the training step.
By employing this equation, PLIER generates a low-dimensional representation of the gene space, where each latent variable (LV) aligns as much as possible to prior knowledge, and which might represent either a known or novel gene module (i.e., a meaningful biological pattern) or noise.

For the drug repurposing and cluster analyses, we applied a model that projected genetic associations from TWAS and gene-drug associations from the LINCS L1000 into a low-dimensional gene module space.
For instance, TWAS associations $\mathbf{M}$ (either from S-PrediXcan or S-MultiXcan) were projected using the following equation:

$$
\hat{\mathbf{M}} = (\mathbf{Z}^{\top} \mathbf{Z} + \lambda_{2} \mathbf{I})^{-1} \mathbf{Z}^{\top} \mathbf{M},
$$ {#eq:proj}

This resulted in a matrix $\hat{\mathbf{M}}^{l \times q}$, where traits were represented by gene modules instead of single genes.
The same approach was used to project drug-induced transcriptional profiles in LINCS L1000 to obtain a representation of drugs using gene modules.


### Regression model for LV-trait associations {#sec:methods:reg}

We adapted the gene-set analysis framework from MAGMA [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004219] to TWAS and used a competitive test to predict gene-trait associations from TWAS using gene weights from an LV.
We tested whether genes with the largest loadings for LV $\ell$ (from $\mathbf{Z}_{\ell}$) were more strongly associated with the phenotype than other genes with relatively small or zero weights.
To this end, we fit the following model:

$$
\mathbf{m}=\beta_{0} + \mathbf{s} \beta_{s} + \sum_{i} \mathbf{x}_{i} \beta_{i} + \bm{\epsilon},
$$ {#eq:reg:model}

where $\mathbf{m}$ is a vector of S-MultiXcan gene $p$-values for a trait (with a $-log_{10}$ transformation); $\mathbf{s}$ is a binary indicator vector with $s_{\ell}=1$ for the top 1% of genes with the largest loadings for LV $\ell$ and zero otherwise; $\mathbf{x}_{i}$ is a gene property used as a covariate; $\beta$ are effect sizes (with $\beta_{0}$ as the intercept); and $\bm{\epsilon} \sim \mathrm{MVN}(0, \sigma^{2} \mathbf{R})$ is a vector of error terms with a multivariate normal distribution (MVN) where $\mathbf{R}$ is the matrix of gene correlations.

We used a logistic regression model to test for a significant association between the gene $\beta_{s}$ and the two covariates.

We tested the null hypothesis $\beta_{s} = 0$ against the one-sided hypothesis $\beta_{s} > 0$.
This was done using a logistic regression model, which also included two gene properties as covariates: gene size (the number of PCs retained in S-MultiXcan) and gene density (the ratio of the number of PCs to the number of tissues available).
The model was based on the MAGMA framework, and its results reflect the difference in trait associations between genes that are part of the latent variable $\ell$ and genes outside of it.

-->
Since the error terms $\bm{\epsilon}$ could be correlated, we cannot assume they have independent normal distributions as in a standard linear regression model.
In the PrediXcan family of methods, the predicted expression of a pair of genes could be correlated if they share eQTLs or if these are in LD [@doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0385-z].
Therefore, we used a generalized least squares approach to account for these correlations.
The gene-gene correlation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ was approximated by computing the correlations between the model sum of squares (SSM) for each pair of genes under the null hypothesis of no association.
These correlations are derived from the individual-level MultiXcan model (Equation (@eq:multixcan)), where the predicted expression matrix $\mathbf{T}_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p_i}$ of a gene $i$ across $p_i$ tissues is projected into its top $k_i$ PCs, resulting in matrix $\mathbf{P}_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k_i}$.
From the MAGMA framework, we know that the SSM for each gene is proportial to $\mathbf{y}^{\top} \mathbf{P}_{i} \mathbf{P}_{i}^{\top} \mathbf{y}$.
Under the null hypothesis of no association, the covariances between the SSM of genes $i$ and $j$ is therefore given by $2 \times \mathrm{Trace}(\mathbf{P}_{i}^{\top} \mathbf{P}_{j} \mathbf{P}_{j}^{\top} \mathbf{P}_{i})$.
The standard deviations of each SSM are given by $\sqrt{2 \times k_{i}} \times (n - 1)$.
Therefore, the correlation between the SSMs for genes $i$ and $j$ can be written as follows:

$$
\begin{split}
\mathbf{R}_{ij} & = \frac{2 \times \mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{P}_{i}^{\top} \mathbf{P}_{j} \mathbf{P}_{j}^{\top} \mathbf{P}_{i})}{\sqrt{2 \times k_{i}} \times \sqrt{2 \times k_{j}} \times (n - 1)^2} \\
& = \frac{2 \times \mathrm{Tr}(Cor(\mathbf{P}_{i}, \mathbf{P}_{j}) \times Cor(\mathbf{P}_{j}, \mathbf{P}_{i}))}{\sqrt{2 \times k_{i}} \times \sqrt{2 \times k_{j}}},
\end{split}
$$ {#eq:reg:r}

where columns $\mathbf{P}$ are standardized, $\mathrm{Tr}$ is the trace of a matrix, and the cross-correlation matrix between PCs $Cor(\mathbf{P}_{i}, \mathbf{P}_{j}) \in \mathbb{R}^{k_i \times k_j}$ is given by

$$
\begin{split}
Cor(\mathbf{P}_{i}, \mathbf{P}_{j}) & = Cor(\mathbf{T}_{i} \mathbf{V}_{i}^{\top} \mathrm{diag}(\lambda_i)^{-1/2}, \mathbf{T}_{j} \mathbf{V}_{j}^{\top} \mathrm{diag}(\lambda_j)^{-1/2}) \\
& = \mathrm{diag}(\lambda_i)^{-1/2} \mathbf{V}_{i} (\frac{\mathbf{T}_{i}^{\top} \mathbf{T}_{j}}{n-1}) \mathbf{V}_{j}^{\top} \mathrm{diag}(\lambda_j)^{-1/2},
\end{split}
$$ {#eq:reg:cor_pp}

where $\frac{\mathbf{T}_{i}^{\top} \mathbf{T}_{j}}{n-1} \in \mathbb{R}^{p_i \times p_j}$ is the cross-correlation matrix between the predicted expression levels of genes $i$ and $j$, and columns of $\mathbf{V}_{i}$ and scalars $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $\mathbf{T}_{i}$, respectively.
S-MultiXcan keeps only the top eigenvectors using a condition number threshold of $\frac{\max(\lambda_i)}{\lambda_i} < 30$.
To estimate the correlation of predicted expression levels for genes $i$ in tissue $k$ and gene $j$ in tissue $l$, $(\mathbf{t}_k^i, \mathbf{t}_l^j)$ ($\mathbf{t}_k^i$ is the $k$th column of $\mathbf{T}_{i}$), we used [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889]

$$
\begin{split}
\frac{(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{\top} \mathbf{T}_{j})_{kl}}{n-1} & = Cor(\mathbf{t}_k^i, \mathbf{t}_l^j) \\
& = \frac{ Cov(\mathbf{t}_k, \mathbf{t}_l) } { \sqrt{\widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_k) \widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_l)} } \\
& = \frac{ Cov(\sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_k} w_a^k X_a, \sum_{b \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_b^l X_b) }  {\sqrt{\widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_k) \widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_l)} } \\
& = \frac{ \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_k \\ b \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_a^k w_b^l Cov(X_a, X_b)} {\sqrt{\widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_k) \widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_l)} } \\
& = \frac{ \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_k \\ b \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_a^k w_b^l \Gamma_{ab}} {\sqrt{\widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_k) \widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_l)} },
\end{split}
$$ {#eq:reg:corr_genes}

where $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$, $w_a^k$ is the weight of SNP $a$ for gene expression prediction in the tissue model $k$, and $\Gamma = \widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{X}) = (\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{\bar{X}})^{\top} (\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{\bar{X}}) / (n-1)$ is the genotype covariance matrix using GTEx v8 as the reference panel, which is the same used in all TWAS methods described here.
The variance of the predicted expression values of gene $i$ in tissue $k$ is estimated as [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]:

$$
\begin{split}
\widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_k^i) & = (\mathbf{W}^k)^\top \Gamma^k \mathbf{W}^k \\
& = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_k \\ b \in \mathrm{model}_k} w_a^k w_b^k \Gamma_{ab}^k.
\end{split}
$$ {#eq:reg:var_gene}


Using the MultiXcan regression model (Equation (@eq:multixcan)), we needed to approximate gene correlations in S-MultiXcan.
To do this, we used the marginal regression estimates from S-PrediXcan in (@eq:spredixcan) with some simplifying assumptions and different genotype covariance matrices.
Since this complicates the derivation of an S-MultiXcan-specific solution to compute $\mathbf{R}$, we used a submatrix $\mathbf{R}_{\ell}$ corresponding to genes that are part of LV $\ell$ only (top 1% of genes) instead of the entire matrix $\mathbf{R}$.
This simplification is conservative since correlations are accounted for top genes only.
Our simulations ([Supplementary Note 1](#sm:reg:null_sim)) show that the model is approximately well-calibrated and can correct for LVs with adjacent and highly correlated genes at the top (e.g., Figure @fig:reg:nulls:qqplot:lv234).
Additionally, the model can detect LVs associated with relevant traits (Figure @fig:lv246 and Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv246) that are replicated in a different cohort (Table @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv246).

For eMERGE, a single correlation matrix was used for all the GWAS.

We computed the correlation matrix in Equation (@eq:reg:corr_genes) for each gene by considering only tissue models present in S-PrediXcan results and SNPs present in the GWAS used as input for the TWAS approaches.
This is necessary to obtain more accurate correlations estimates [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889].
For PhenomeXcan, we used a single correlation matrix for the UK Biobank GWAS (4,049) that were generated using the same pipeline and included the same set of SNPs.
For the remaining GWAS, we used a single correlation matrix for each group of traits that shared the same or most of the SNPs.
For eMERGE, we used a single correlation matrix for all the GWAS.

We generated gene expression patterns for each trait by clustering the genes based on their Pearson correlation coefficient, using the Spearman correlation for traits with a skewed distribution.
We then used the clustering results to identify the gene expression patterns associated with the disease etiology and drug mechanisms.


### LV-based drug repurposing approach {#sec:methods:drug}

We used a drug repositioning framework previously used for psychiatry traits [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] to derive a Latent Variable (LV)-based method for drug-disease prediction.
This method was compared to the single-gene approach.
For the single-gene method, we computed a drug-disease score by multiplying a set of signed $z$-scores in tissue $t$ ($\mathbf{M}^t$) with another set of signed $z$-scores from transcriptional responses profiled in LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] ($\mathbf{L}^{c \times m}$).
$\mathbf{M}^t$ contains information about whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with disease risk, while $\mathbf{L}$ indicates whether a drug increases or decreases the expression of a gene.
This product yields $\mathbf{D}^{t,k}=-1 \cdot \mathbf{M}^{t,k} \mathbf{L}^\top$, where $k$ refers to the number of most significant gene associations in $\mathbf{M}^t$ for each trait.
As suggested in [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618], $k$ can be either all genes or the top 50, 100, 250, or 500.
We then averaged the score ranks across all $k$ to obtain $\mathbf{D}^t$.
Finally, we took the maximum prediction score across all tissues for each drug-disease pair: $\mathbf{D}_{ij} = \max \{ \mathbf{D}_{ij}^t \mid \forall t \}$.


We used the same procedure to project $\mathbf{M}^t$ and $\mathbf{L}$ into the latent space of gene modules using Equation (@eq:proj).
This gave us $\hat{\mathbf{M}}^t$ and $\hat{\mathbf{L}}^{l \times c}$, respectively.
Finally, we calculated $\mathbf{D}^{t,k}=-1 \cdot \hat{\mathbf{L}}^{\top} \hat{\mathbf{M}}^{t,k}$, where $k$ could be all LVs or the top 5, 10, 25 and 50 (as there were an order of magnitude fewer LVs than genes).


We used the following equation to calculate the similarity between two traits: 

To project genetic associations to gene expression, we used a similarity measure between two traits.
We calculated the similarity between two traits using the following equation:

$$sim(t_1,t_2) = \frac{\sum_{g_1 \in t_1}\sum_{g_2 \in t_2} \text{cosine}(g_1,g_2)}{\sqrt{|t_1||t_2|}}$$

where $t_1$ and $t_2$ are traits, $g_1$ and $g_2$ are genes, and cosine is the cosine similarity between two


### Consensus clustering of traits {#sec:methods:clustering}

We performed two preprocessing steps on the S-MultiXcan results before the cluster analysis.
First, we combined results in $\mathbf{M}$ (with $p$-values converted to $z$-scores, as described previously) for traits that mapped to the same Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq099] term using the Stouffer's method: $\sum w_i M_{ij} / \sqrt{\sum w_i^2}$, where $w_i$ is a weight based on the GWAS sample size for trait $i$, and $M_{ij}$ is the $z$-score for gene $j$.
Second, we divided all $z$-scores for each trait $i$ by their sum to reduce the effect of highly polygenic traits: $M_{ij} / \sum M_{ij}$.
Finally, we projected this data matrix using Equation (@eq:proj), obtaining $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ with $n$=3,752 traits and $l$=987 latent variables (LVs) as the input of our clustering pipeline.


A partitioning of $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ with $n$ traits into $k$ clusters is represented as a label vector $\pi \in \mathbb{N}^n$.
To obtain the optimal partition $\pi^*$, we employed a consensus clustering approach which consists of two steps: 1) the generation of an ensemble $\Pi$ with $r$ partitions of the dataset: $\Pi=\{\pi_1, \pi_2, \ldots, \pi_r\}$, and 2) the combination of the ensemble into a consolidated solution defined as:

$$
\pi^* = \mathrm{arg}\,\underset{\hat{\pi}}{\max} Q(\{ \lvert \mathcal{L}^i \lvert \phi(\hat{\pi}_{\mathcal{L}^i}, \pi_{i \mathcal{L}^i}) \mid i \in \{1,\ldots,r\} \}),
$$ {#eq:consensus:obj_func}

where $\mathcal{L}^i$ is a set of data indices with known cluster labels for partition $i$, $\phi\colon \mathbb{N}^n \times \mathbb{N}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is a function that measures the similarity between two partitions, and $Q$ is a measure of central tendency, such as the mean or median.
We used the adjusted Rand index (ARI) [@doi:10.1007/BF01908075] for $\phi$ and the median for $Q$.
To derive the final partition $\pi^*$, we employed a consensus function $\Gamma\colon \mathbb{N}^{n \times r} \to \mathbb{N}^n$ with $\Pi$ as the input.
We used consensus functions based on the evidence accumulation clustering (EAC) paradigm [@doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2005.113], where $\Pi$ is first transformed into a distance matrix $\mathbf{D}_{ij} = d_{ij} / r$, where $d_{ij}$ is the number of times traits $i$ and $j$ were grouped in different clusters across all $r$ partitions in $\Pi$.
Then, $\Gamma$ can be any similarity-based clustering algorithm, which is applied on $\mathbf{D}$ to derive the final partition $\pi^*$.


We used different algorithms to create a highly diverse set of partitions (see Figure @fig:clustering:design).
To ensure diversity, we used three data representations: raw data, its projection into the top 50 principal components, and the embedding learned by UMAP [@arxiv:1802.03426] with 50 components.
We applied five clustering algorithms: $k$-means [@Arthur2007], spectral clustering [@Ng2001], a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN [@Ester1996].
For $k$-means, spectral clustering, and GMM, we specified a range of $k$ between 2 and $\sqrt{n} \approx 60$, and for each $k$ we generated five partitions using random seeds.
For hierarchical clustering, for each $k$, we generated four partitions using common linkage criteria: ward, complete, average and single.
For DBSCAN, we combined different ranges for parameters $\epsilon$ (the maximum distance between two data points to be considered part of the same neighborhood) and *minPts* (the minimum number of data points in a neighborhood for a data point to be considered a core point) based on the procedure in [@doi:10.1088/1755-1315/31/1/012012].
Specifically, we used *minPts* values from 2 to 125 and determined a plausible range of $\epsilon$ values by observing the distribution of the mean distance of the *minPts*-nearest neighbors across all data points.
To ensure an equal representation of DBSCAN in the ensemble, we resampled partitions.
This process generated a final ensemble of 4,428 partitions of 3,752 traits.


Finally, we used spectral clustering on $\mathbf{D}$ to derive the final consensus partitions.
We transformed $\mathbf{D}$ into a similarity matrix by applying an RBF kernel $\mathrm{exp}(-\gamma \mathbf{D}^2)$, using four different values for $\gamma$ that were empirically determined to work best.
To select the best solution, we evaluated Equation (@eq:consensus:obj_func) for each $k$ between 2 and 60, and then filtered this set of 59 solutions to keep only those with an ensemble agreement larger than the 75th percentile (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:clustering:agreement).
Ultimately, this left us with 15 final consensus partitions, as shown in Figure @fig:clustering:tree.

Our clustering pipeline includes several linear and nonlinear transformations, such as PCA, UMAP, and the ensemble transformation using the EAC paradigm (distance matrix $\mathbf{D}$).
Although consensus clustering has advantages for biological data [@pmid:27303057], it complicates the interpretation of results.
To address this, we used a supervised learning approach to detect which gene modules/LVs were most important for each cluster of traits (Figure {@fig:clustering:design}b).
This supervised model was not used for prediction, but only to identify which features (LVs) were most discriminative for each cluster.
We used the highest resolution partition ($k$=29) to train a decision tree model using each of the clusters as labels and the projected data $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ as the training samples.
We created a set of binary labels with the current cluster's traits as the positive class and the rest of the traits as the negative class.
Then, we selected the LV in the root node of the trained model if its threshold was positive and larger than one standard deviation, and removed this LV from $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$.
This process was repeated 20 times to extract the top 20 LVs that best discriminate traits in a cluster from the rest.

We used a permutation test to compare the observed maximum silhouette coefficient (S_max) to the expected S_max from the null model.
The expected S_max was calculated as the average of S_max values from 1000 permutations of the data.
We then used a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the observed S_max to the expected S_max (W = 5, p = 0.0018).

To verify that the clustering results were real, we


### CRISPR-Cas9 screening {#sec:methods:crispr}

Cell culture was conducted using HepG2 cells obtained from ATCC (ATCC® HB-8065™).
The cells were maintained in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium with L-Glutamine (EMEM, Cat.
112-018-101, Quality Biology) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Gibco, Cat.16000-044) and 1% Pen/Strep (Gibco, Cat.15140-122).
The cells were kept in a humidity-controlled incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2, and were kept at a density not exceeding 80% confluency.

The 3rd generation Broad GPP genome-wide Human Brunello CRISPR knockout Pooled library (Cat.
73179-LV) was used for HepG2 cell transduction.
This library consists of 76,441 sgRNAs, targeting 19,114 genes in the human genome, with an average of 4 sgRNAs per gene.
Each 20nt sgRNA cassette was inserted into the lentiCRIS-PRv2 backbone between the U6 promoter and gRNA scaffold.
The lentiviral vectors encoding Cas9 were used to deliver the sgRNA cassette containing plasmids into cells during cell replication; unsuccessful transduced cells were excluded through puromycin selection.

No-spin lentiviral transduction was utilized for the screen.
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates in the presence of 8ug/ml polybrene, and a different titrated virus volume (e.g., 0, 50, 100, 200, 250, and 400ul) was assigned to each well.
16-18hrs post-transduction, virus/polybrene-containing media was removed and cells were washed twice with 1x DPBS.
At 24h, cells were trypsinized, diluted (e.g.,1:10), and seeded in pairs of wells of 6-well plates.
At 60hr post-transduction, cell media in each well was replaced with fresh EMEM and 2ug/ml of puromycin was added to one well out of the pair.
2-5 days after puromycin selection, cells in both wells with/without puromycin were collected and counted for viability.
The Percentage of Infection (PI%) was obtained by comparing the cell numbers with/without puromycin selection within each pair.
Poisson's distribution theory was used to calculate that when the transduction efficiency (PI%) is between 30-50%, corresponding to an MOI (Multiplicity of Infection) of ~0.35-0.70, around 95% of infected cells have only one copy of the virus.
Therefore, a virus volume of 120ul yielding 30-40% of transduction efficiency was chosen for further large-scale viral transduction.

Genomic DNA was isolated from the pooled cells for sgRNA library sequencing.

To transduce a lentiviral Brunello CRISPR Knockout Pooled Library into HepG2 cells, we seeded 2.5 million cells per well in fourteen 6-well plates, with 8 μg/ml of polybrene, and added 120 μl of the virus to each experimental well.
18 hours post-transduction, we removed the virus/PB mix medium and pooled the cells into T175 flasks.
At 60 hours post-transduction, we added 2 μg/ml of puromycin to each flask and changed the medium every two days with fresh EMEM and 2 μg/ml of puromycin.
Seven days after puromycin selection, we collected, pooled, counted, and replated the cells, then isolated genomic DNA from the pooled cells for sgRNA library sequencing.
This process was designed to achieve a coverage of at least 500 cells per sgRNA, with an MOI of 0.3-0.4 to ensure 95% of infected cells get only one viral particle per cell.

After puromycin selection, 20-30 million cells were collected as Unsorted Control and stored at -80oC for further genomic DNA isolation.
The remaining cells (approximately 200 million) were assigned to two groups and kept in 100mm dishes.
These cells were stained with LipidSpotTM 488 (Biotium, Cat.
70065-T), a fluorescent dye diluted to 1:100 with DPBS.
The staining solution was incubated at 37oC for 30 minutes, and cell images were captured through fluorescent microscope EVOS for GFP signal detection (Figure @fig:sup:crispr:fig1).

Cells were collected into 50mL tubes and spun at 500 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
After a DPBS wash, the cell pellets were resuspended in FACS Sorting Buffer (1x DPBS without Ca2+/Mg2+, 2.5mM EDTA, 25mM HEPES, 1% BSA; the solution was filter-sterilized and kept at 4°C) and gently pipetted to form single cells.
The cell solution was then filtered through a cell strainer (Falcon, Cat.
352235) and kept on ice, protected from light.
Cells were then sorted on a FACSJazz using a 100μm nozzle, collecting approximately 20% of the GFP-High and GFP-Low (Figure @fig:sup:crispr:fig2) into 15mL tubes.
After sorting, cells were immediately spun down and the pellets were stored at -80°C for further genomic DNA isolation.

Genomic DNA was isolated from three conditions (Un-Sorted Control, lentiV2 GFP-High, and lentiV2 GFP-Low) using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat.
51104).
The quality and quantity of the gDNA was assessed using UV Spectroscopy (Nanodrop).
A total of 80-160ug of gDNA was isolated for each condition.
The presence of the sgRNA cassette and lentiviral specific transgene in the isolated gDNA was verified through PCR (Figure @fig:sup:crispr:fig3).

Illumina libraries were generated and sequenced for this study.
Primers were designed based on Broad Institute protocol and synthesized through Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT).
For each condition, 32 PCR reactions (each consisting of 5ug of gDNA, 5ul of each 10uM P5 and P7, and ExTaq DNA Polymerase) were set up and amplified.
The PCR Thermal Cycler Parameters were set as Initial at 95oC for 1min; followed by 24 cycles of Denaturation at 94oC for 30 seconds, Annealing at 52.5oC for 30 seconds, Extension at 72oC for 30 seconds, and a final Elongation at 72oC for 10 minutes.
The expected PCR product size was 285bp-293bp (Figure @fig:sup:crispr:fig4 A).
The PCR products within the same condition were pooled and purified using SPRIselect beads.
The quality and quantity of the library were then analyzed on Qubit and Bio-analyzer, respectively.
A single approximate 285bp peak was expected (Figure @fig:sup:crispr:fig4 B).
Finally, the Illumina library samples were sequenced on Nova-seq 6000, pooled and loaded on an SP flow cell, along with a 20% PhiX control v3 library spike-in.


### Code and data availability

We used a two-step approach to identify gene co-expression patterns associated with disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
First, we performed hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles across samples using the average linkage method and Euclidean distance as a measure of similarity (Eq.
1).
